# MERN-Dashboard

## *WORK IN PROGRESS*
This is my first attempt at a full-stack web app using a MERN stack. 

For frontend, this app uses Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query. For backend using Node JS, Express Js, Mongoose, and MongoDB

In order to clone this repo and cd into the client folder and run:
```npm run start```
The web app will run in http://localhost:3000/dashboard
