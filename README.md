# React-Dashboard

## *WORK IN PROGRESS*
This is my first attempt at a full-stack web app. My app uses React for frontend, Express.js for routing and middleware, Node for backend, and SQL for the database.

The frontend components were built using Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Recharts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query.

To run this app locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. CD into server and client folders and run ```npm install```.
3. CD into the server folder run ```node . ```
4. CD into the client folder run ```npm run start```

The web app will run in http://localhost:3000/dashboard

To access the backend data you will need .env variables. Please contact me if you would like to make a pull request.
